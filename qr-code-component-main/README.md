# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

This is my solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). The goal is to recreate the QR card design as closely as possible and practice basic layout skills.

## Built with

- How to use the figure / figcaption pattern for better semantics.

## AI collaboration

I used an AI assistant in Cursor to review my HTML structure, suggest accessibility improvements, and help refine this `README.md`. All code changes were still implemented and verified by me.
